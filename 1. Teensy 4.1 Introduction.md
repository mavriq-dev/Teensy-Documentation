The processor thinks ahead, predicting your code's next move. With dynamic prediction and zero-cycle branches for correct guesses, your programs flow smoothly even through complex decision trees.

#### Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
Built for real-world applications, the DSP features let you process signals like a pro. SIMD operations handle multiple data points at once, while MAC operations and saturating arithmetic make audio and signal processing a joy.

### Pins

#### Digital Input/Output
With 55 digital I/O pins at your command, each one is a Swiss Army knife of functionality. Configure them with internal pullup/pulldown resistors, catch events with interrupts, or set them up for PWM output - the possibilities are endless.

#### Digital Output Configuration
These aren't your ordinary output pins. Adjust slew rates to tame EMI, tune drive strength for perfect signaling, and dial in the bandwidth for your specific needs. Plus, there's a handy LED on pin 13 for when you need that classic blink test!

#### Input Characteristics
Smart inputs that work with you: configurable hysteresis keeps noise at bay, built-in pullup/pulldown resistors save you board space, and 5V tolerance on most pins means less worry about voltage matching.

#### Analog Capabilities
Need to measure the real world? 18 analog inputs with 12-bit resolution give you precise readings from 0 to 3.3V. Two independent ADCs can sample at up to 1 Msps, and hardware averaging helps you get clean, accurate measurements.

#### Analog Comparators
Two high-speed comparators stand ready for threshold detection, complete with programmable hysteresis and flexible triggering options. Perfect for creating quick responses to analog events without CPU overhead.

### Memory System
The Teensy 4.1's internal memory consists of 1024KB RAM split between DTCM (Data Tightly Coupled Memory) for fast access and OCRAM (On-Chip RAM) for general use. Program storage uses 8192KB of QSPI flash memory, providing ample space for complex applications.

For projects needing additional storage, the board includes a MicroSD card slot with a native 4-bit SDIO interface. Memory can be further expanded using optional PSRAM (up to 8MB) and additional QSPI flash.

### Communication Interfaces

#### USB Capabilities
The primary USB port is a powerhouse, supporting multiple protocols simultaneously including USB MIDI, RAW HID, MTP and Audio Class 2.0. The Audio Class 2.0 support enables high-quality digital audio transfer. Comprehensive HID support covers keyboard, mouse, and joystick emulation. MTP support allows easy file access from computers.

#### USB Host Port
The Teensy 4.1 features a second USB port with full host capabilities. This port allows direct connection to USB devices, complete with power management for connected peripherals. Supporting high-speed transfers at 480 Mbit/sec, it can work with USB hubs to connect multiple devices simultaneously, making it perfect for complex projects requiring USB device control.

#### Serial Communication
Serial communication is robust with eight hardware serial ports at your disposal. Each port can handle standard baud rates up to 4 Mbps, featuring hardware FIFOs for reliable data transfer without losing bytes. Select ports offer flow control options, and all ports offer   DMA support for efficient, CPU-independent data handling, making them ideal for high-speed communication tasks.

#### Industrial Protocols
The Teensy 4.1 speaks the language of industrial automation with its comprehensive protocol support. Three I2C and SPI ports handle sensor and display interfaces and enable high-speed data transfers. For industrial networking, three CAN Bus interfaces (including one with CAN FD support) provide robust communication. 

#### FlexIO
The FlexIO module is a versatile peripheral that can emulate various communication interfaces or create custom protocols. At its core, it consists of 32-bit shift registers for data movement and 16-bit timers for precise timing control. The module supports up to 32 digital pins that can be configured as inputs or outputs.

The hardware includes four key components:
1. Shifters that handle data serialization and deserialization
2. Timers for generating clocks and controlling shifters
3. Pin multiplexing for flexible I/O configuration
4. DMA support for autonomous operation

FlexIO can emulate standard interfaces like UART, SPI, and I2C, but its real power lies in handling specialized protocols. For example, it excels at tasks like driving WS2812 LED strips, implementing camera interfaces, or creating parallel bus interfaces. The module can operate in either master or slave mode, and its triggers can be linked to other peripherals for synchronized operation.

Further details can be found in the [NXPFlexIO Introduction](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/supporting-information/FTF-ACC-F1179_Introduction_to_FlexIO.pdf).

#### Ethernet
The Teensy 4.1 includes a 10/100 Mbit Ethernet controller with IEEE1588 precision time protocol support. While the Ethernet hardware is built into the board, it requires an [RJ45 magjack kit](https://www.pjrc.com/store/ethernet_kit.html) to connect to networks. The DP83825 PHY supports both MII and RMII modes, and the hardware includes dedicated DMA channels for efficient packet handling.

#### Power

##### Power Supply Options
The Teensy 4.1 offers flexible power input options. It can be powered through USB (5V), an external power supply via the VIN pin (3.6V to 5.5V recommended), or regulated 3.3V directly. The board includes protection circuits for safe hot-plugging of USB connections and reverse polarity protection on the VIN input.

##### Power Distribution
The onboard 3.3V regulator can supply up to 250mA to external devices. The USB port provides 5V when available, which can be used to power additional peripherals. A dedicated VBAT pin connects to a battery backup system for keeping the real-time clock and small amounts of RAM powered during main power loss.

##### Power Management
The processor supports multiple power-saving modes. In deep sleep mode, power consumption can drop to microamps while still maintaining critical functions. The CPU voltage can be dynamically adjusted to balance performance and power consumption. The ON/OFF pin provides hardware control for complete system power management.

##### Power Consumption
The power consumption varies with CPU speed and active peripherals:
- 600 MHz operation: 100mA typical
- 24 MHz operation: 20mA typical
- Sleep mode with USB: 9mA
- Deep sleep (Snooze library): 100µA

To minimize power usage, disable unused peripherals and configure unused pins as inputs with pulldowns.

### Peripheral Systems

#### Interrupt Handling
The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) supports up to 240 interrupt sources with 16 priority levels. It enables fast interrupt response with automatic state saving and tail-chaining for efficient handling of multiple interrupts.

#### DMA System
The Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller features 32 channels that operate independently of the CPU. Each channel supports configurable priority levels and can perform memory-to-memory, peripheral-to-memory, or memory-to-peripheral transfers. The DMA system reduces CPU overhead by handling data movement tasks autonomously.

#### Timer Systems
The timer architecture includes multiple FlexTimer modules for precise timing control. Each module supports various operating modes including input capture, output compare, and PWM generation. Additional programmable delay timers allow accurate timing intervals from microseconds to hours.

#### Analog Processing
The analog subsystem contains two 12-bit Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) capable of sampling at up to 1 MHz. Two analog comparators provide fast voltage comparison with programmable hysteresis. 

#### Temperature Sensor
An internal temperature sensor enables system temperature monitoring and thermal management.
